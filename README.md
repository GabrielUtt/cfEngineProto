# Banking Cash Flow Engine

A prototype of a banking cash flow engine.

## Explanation

A cash flow engine is a software tool to calculate, model and project cash
flows associated with financial instruments. It allows to 
- generate cash flows based on contractual obligations or assumptions
- model how cashflows change under different scenarios
- project cash flows over time
- calculate the present values of cash flows

The cash flow engine serves as the basis to do further analysis, like risk
calculations, or reports, like regulatory reporting (NSFR, LCR)


## Idea and Purpose

Build a prototpye banking cash flow engine using a few selected, simple 
products for learning purposes, like

- architectural understanding, building a one-in-all engine from scratch
- financial understanding
- applying agile methodologies, like building MVPs, using Kanban boards, etc.
- use as project for Edx/IBM DevOps and Software Engineering certificate
- using containers
- etc.
